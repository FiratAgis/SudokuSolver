# SudokuSolver
My attempt on 16x16 sudoku solver during semester break, not yet completed because I got corona, might finish it someday. Includes naked singles, exclusion, pairs, triples, double exclusion, X-Wing, quads, swordfish, geometric tricks using set theory, pentas, hexas, septas, and heptas. Does not have bruteforce methods, so it can not solve hardest options but still very powerful.
